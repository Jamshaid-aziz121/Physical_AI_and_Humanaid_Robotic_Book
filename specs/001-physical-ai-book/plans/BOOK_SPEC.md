# BOOK_SPEC.md - Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Objective
Create a comprehensive, spec-driven technical book that teaches Physical AI and embodied intelligence concepts through practical implementation with humanoid robots using real-world robotics stacks. The book will bridge the gap between digital AI systems and physical robotics applications, enabling readers to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots with integrated AI capabilities.

## Scope / Non-Scope
**In Scope:**
- Educational content covering ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and LLM integration
- Practical modules with hands-on exercises and simulations
- Technical documentation for humanoid robot control and perception
- Simulation-to-real workflows for robotics development
- Capstone project integrating all concepts into an autonomous humanoid system
- Deployment via Docusaurus to GitHub Pages

**Out of Scope:**
- Hardware implementation or physical robot construction
- Detailed mathematical derivations beyond essential understanding
- Commercial product development or monetization strategies
- Advanced control theory mathematics beyond practical application
- Non-robotics AI applications (e.g., pure computer vision, NLP without robotics context)

## Key Concepts
- **Physical AI**: AI systems that interact with and operate in the physical world
- **Embodied Intelligence**: Intelligence that emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment
- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: Middleware for robot control and communication
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Robots with human-like form and capabilities
- **Simulation-to-Real**: Methodology for developing robotics systems in simulation before deployment to physical robots
- **VLA (Vision-Language-Action)**: Integration of visual perception, language understanding, and physical action in robotics
- **Digital Twin**: Virtual replica of a physical robot used for simulation and testing

## Inputs
- Technical knowledge of Python, AI/ML basics, linear algebra, and Linux
- Development environment with ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, and related tools
- Source code examples and simulation environments

## Outputs
- Comprehensive technical book with modules covering Physical AI concepts
- Practical exercises and code examples for each module
- Simulated humanoid robot capable of voice command processing, navigation, and manipulation
- Deployed documentation website with interactive content

## Tools & Frameworks
- **Authoring**: Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code
- **Robotics**: ROS 2 (Humble/Iron)
- **Simulation**: Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Unity
- **AI**: SLAM, perception models, LLMs
- **Publishing**: Docusaurus → GitHub Pages
