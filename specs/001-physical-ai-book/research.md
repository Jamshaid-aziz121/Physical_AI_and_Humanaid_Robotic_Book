# Research Findings for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Decision: Technology Stack Selection
**Rationale**: Selected proven, widely-used technologies in robotics and AI to ensure reproducibility and community support.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom robotics frameworks vs. ROS 2 (chose ROS 2 for industry standard)
- Different simulation platforms vs. Gazebo (chose Gazebo for ROS 2 integration)
- Various LLM providers vs. standard APIs (chose standard APIs for accessibility)

## Decision: Target Audience Prerequisites
**Rationale**: Targeted at CS graduates and robotics engineers with specific technical background to ensure appropriate complexity level.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Beginners vs. intermediate audience (chose intermediate for practical implementation focus)
- General AI vs. robotics-focused content (chose robotics-specific for depth)

## Decision: Simulation-to-Real Approach
**Rationale**: Using simulation as primary teaching method with clear pathways to real hardware to balance safety, cost, and learning effectiveness.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Real hardware only vs. simulation (chose simulation-first for accessibility)
- Multiple simulation platforms vs. focused approach (chose focused for clarity)

## Decision: Modular Content Structure
**Rationale**: Organized content in four progressive modules to build skills incrementally while maintaining modularity for reuse.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Linear vs. modular structure (chose modular for flexibility)
- Topic-based vs. skill-based organization (chose skill-based for progression)

## Decision: Assessment and Validation Methods
**Rationale**: Implemented measurable success criteria to validate learning outcomes and technical accuracy.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Qualitative vs. quantitative assessments (chose quantitative for objectivity)
- Self-assessment vs. automated validation (chose mixed approach for comprehensiveness)
